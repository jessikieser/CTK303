        <p class="song">Have you ever loved somebody so much<br>
          It makes you cry?<br>
          Have you ever needed somethin' so bad<br>
          You can't sleep at night?<br>
          Have you ever tried to find the words<br>
          But they don't come out right?<br>
          Have you ever? Have you ever?
        </p>
        <p class="song">Have you ever been in love<br>
          Been in love so bad<br>
          You'd do anything to make them understand?<br>
          Have you ever had someone steal your heart away?<br>
          You'd give anything up to make them feel the same<br>
          Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart?<br>
          But you don't know what to say<br>
          And you don't know where to start
        </p>
        <p class="song">Have you ever loved somebody so much<br>
          It makes you cry?<br>
          Have you ever needed somethin' so bad<br>
          You can't sleep at night?<br>
          Have you ever tried to find the words<br>
          But they don't come out right<br>
          Have you ever? (Have you ever?)<br>
          Have you ever?
        </p>
        <p class="song">Have you ever found the one<br>
          You've dreamed of all your life?<br>
          You'd do just about anything to look into their eyes<br>
          Have you finally found the one you've given your heart to?<br>
          Only to find that one won't give their heart to you<br>
          Have you ever closed your eyes and<br>
          Dreamed that they were there?<br>
          And all you can do is wait for that day when they will care
        </p>
        <p class="song">Have you ever loved somebody so much<br>
          It makes you cry? (Make you wanna break down and cry)<br>
          Have you ever needed something so bad (so, so bad)<br>
          You can't sleep at night<br>
          Have you ever tried to find the words<br>
          But they don't come out right?<br>
          Have you ever? Have you ever, ever, ever?
        </p>
        <p class="song">What do I gotta do to get you in my arms baby?<br>
          What do I gotta say to get to your heart?<br>
          To make you understand how I need you next to me<br>
          Gotta get you in my world<br>
          'Cause, baby, I can't sleep
        </p>

          Have you ever tried to find the words<br>
          But they don't come out right? (Don't come out right)<br>
          Have you ever? (Have you ever?)<br>
