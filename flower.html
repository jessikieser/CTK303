      <p>Self-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the
        stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. Cross-pollination
        is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another
        flower on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happened
        in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned
        so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not
        require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[1] <br><br>

        In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been
        admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of
        romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.</p>
